# Clinical Algorithms with Race

Clinical algorithms include diagnostic calculators that assess the current presence of a disease or condition, prognostic algorithms that predict the future risk of a disease or health outcome, treatment guidelines for managing chronic conditions, interpretation recommendations for laboratory test results, and precision directions for medication use. Here we focus on risk calculators that use race as a predictor, laboratory test results with different reference ranges recommended for different races, therapy recommendations based on race, and medications with guidelines for initiation and monitoring based on race.
